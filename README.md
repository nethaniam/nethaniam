## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š!

My name is Nethania. I am a recent computer engineering graduate from California State University, Northridge. I have a strong passion for robotics, creating software solutions, building hardware, using the knowledge I have gained to help solve problems using tech, and continuing to grow as a computer engineer through project creation.
